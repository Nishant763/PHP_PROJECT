            <!-- Etymology -->
            <h3 class="history-heading2">Etymology</h3>
            <p class="history-para">
              The name Mumbai is derived from Mumbā or Mahā-Ambā—the name of the patron goddess (kuladevata) Mumbadevi of the native Koli community—[38] and ā'ī meaning "mother" in the Marathi language,
               which is the mother tongue of the Koli people and the official language of Maharashtra.[22][39] The Koli people originated in Kathiawad and Central Gujarat, and according to some sources they brought their 
               goddess Mumba with them from Kathiawad (Gujarat), where she is still worshipped.[23][24] However, other sources disagree that Mumbai's name was derived from the goddess Mumba.

            <h3 class="history-heading2">Economy</h3>
            <p class="history-para">Mumbai is India's largest city (by population) and is the financial and commercial capital of the country as it generates 6.16% of the total GDP.[31][145][188] It serves as an economic hub of India, contributing 10% of factory employment, 25% of industrial output, 33% of income tax collections, 60% of customs duty collections, 20% of central excise tax collections, 40% of India's foreign trade and ₹40 billion (US$560 million) in corporate taxes.[189] Along with the rest of India, Mumbai has witnessed an economic boom since the liberalisation of 1991, the finance boom in the mid-nineties and the IT, export, services and outsourcing boom in the 2000s.[190] Although Mumbai had prominently figured as the hub of economic activity of India in the 1990s, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is presently witnessing a reduction in its contribution to India's GDP.</p>
